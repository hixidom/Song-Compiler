Song Compiler, by Andrew Barrette

Compiles music code and plays back the resulting composition. Music code is designed to be fully generalized but many features are still disabled due to bugs.

EXECUTION:
Running songcomp1.0.exe as is will cause it to compile the file ToCompile.txt.
Running in Windows terminal with "songcomp1.0.exe filename.txt" will instead compile filename.txt.
